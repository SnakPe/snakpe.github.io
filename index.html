  <h1> Hello, traveler </h1>
  <p>
    My name is Snake, but since that name is already taken on github, you may call me Snakpe (or Andreas, i guess?)<br>
    I like to pretend like I can code, but I am not so sure of it <br>
    it took me an hour to figure out how to move files in github lol <br>
